  Use this skill for all Atomemo plugin development work — creating plugin projects,
  building Tool plugins (functions that wrap external APIs or local logic), defining
  Model plugins (LLM integrations), setting up credential systems, configuring
  parameters, debugging plugin hub connection issues, or publishing to the official
  marketplace. Also invoke this when a developer wants to expose their code or a
  third-party service to Atomemo users, even if they don't use the word "plugin".
  Do NOT invoke for other plugin ecosystems (VS Code extensions, Chrome extensions,
  Obsidian plugins, Figma plugins, Raycast extensions), generic npm package publishing
  unrelated to Atomemo, or general Atomemo platform usage questions (workflow
  scheduling, trigger setup, node configuration, workflow design) that are not
  specifically about building or publishing plugins.

# Atomemo Plugin Development

You are helping a developer build an Atomemo plugin. Atomemo is Choiceform's workflow
automation platform. Plugins extend it with new Tools (external API calls, functions)
and Models (LLM definitions).

## Architecture Overview

```plain
Host (Atomemo App)
      ↕  (secure, decoupled)
  Plugin Hub              ← intermediary, handles security + comms
      ↕
  Your Plugin             ← SDK + your business logic
```

- **Plugin Hub**: Prevents direct host↔plugin contact; protects both sides
- **SDK** (`@choiceopen/atomemo-plugin-sdk-js`): Handles communication, types, i18n, lifecycle
- **CLI** (`@choiceopen/atomemo-plugin-cli`): Project scaffolding, dev server, build, publish

## Two Plugin Types

| Type | What it does | Source directory |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Tool** | Invokes external APIs or runs local logic | `src/tools/` |
| **Model** | Describes an LLM (capabilities, pricing, params) | `src/models/` |

A single plugin can contain multiple Tools AND multiple Models.

## Identify the Scenario

**Scenario A — New project from scratch:**
Read `references/quick-start.md`, then the appropriate type guide.

**Scenario B — Adding to an existing project:**
Read the relevant guide directly:

- Adding a Tool → `references/tool-plugin.md`
- Adding a Model → `references/model-plugin.md`
- Adding Credentials → `references/credential.md`
- Configuring Parameters → `references/declarative-parameters.md`

**Scenario C — Publishing:**
Read `references/publishing.md`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Clarify intent

Ask (or infer from context):

1. New project or adding to an existing one?
2. Tool plugin, Model plugin, or both?
3. Does it need credentials (API keys, tokens)?
4. Target language? (TypeScript strongly recommended)

### Step 2: Set up the project (new projects only)

See `references/quick-start.md`. Key commands:

```bash
atomemo auth login
atomemo plugin init        # interactive: name, description, language
cd <plugin-name>
atomemo plugin refresh-key
bun install
bun run dev
```

### Step 3: Implement plugin components

For each component:

1. Create the definition file in the appropriate directory
2. Implement the required interface (`satisfies ToolDefinition` / `ModelDefinition` / `CredentialDefinition`)
3. Register in `src/index.ts`

**Project file layout:**

```plain
src/
  index.ts           ← entry point; register everything here
  tools/             ← one file per tool
  models/            ← one file per model
  credentials/       ← one file per credential type
  i18n/              ← translations (auto-generated by SDK)
```

**Registration pattern (index.ts):**

```typescript
import { createPlugin } from "@choiceopen/atomemo-plugin-sdk-js"
import { myTool } from "./tools/my-tool"
import { myModel } from "./models/my-model"
import { myCredential } from "./credentials/my-credential"

const plugin = await createPlugin({ /* manifest fields */ })
plugin.addTool(myTool)
plugin.addModel(myModel)
plugin.addCredential(myCredential)
plugin.run()
```

### Step 4: Internationalization

All user-facing strings support i18n. **Always use the `t()` helper** — it keeps
translations centralized and consistent across the project:

```typescript
import { t } from "../i18n/i18n-node"

display_name: t("WEATHER_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAME"),
description: t("WEATHER_TOOL_DESCRIPTION"),
```

Only fall back to inline `I18nText` objects `{ en_US: "...", zh_Hans: "..." }` when
the `t()` helper is not available (e.g., in one-off scripts or test fixtures).

### Step 5: Test locally

```bash
bun run dev          # starts dev mode with Hub connection
# or after build:
bun run ./dist       # connects to Hub
```

Successful connection shows: `status: ok, response: { success: true }`

### Step 6: Publish (when ready)

See `references/publishing.md`. Key steps:

1. `bun run release` — validates, builds, syncs versions
2. Fork `atomemo-official-plugins` repo
3. Add plugin to `plugins/<your-plugin-name>/`
4. Open PR with title `feat(plugin): add <your-plugin-name>`

## Reference Files

Load these on demand based on what the developer needs:

| File | When to read |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `references/quick-start.md` | New project setup |
| `references/tool-plugin.md` | Building Tool plugins |
| `references/model-plugin.md` | Building Model plugins |
| `references/credential.md` | Defining credentials |
| `references/declarative-parameters.md` | Parameter types and UI config |
| `references/declarative-parameters-examples.md` | Ready-to-copy parameter examples |
| `references/publishing.md` | Publishing to the marketplace |

## CLI Automation

When helping a developer set up a new project, you can execute CLI commands on their behalf using the Bash tool — except for `atomemo auth login`, which requires the user to complete OAuth in a browser.

**What you can run automatically:**

```bash
# Non-interactive project init — provide all flags to skip prompts:
atomemo plugin init --no-interactive -n <plugin-name> -d "<description>" -l typescript

# These are always non-interactive:
atomemo plugin refresh-key
bun install
bun run dev
```

**What requires user action:**

`atomemo auth login` uses a device authorization flow. You cannot automate it.
Instead, guide the user: tell them to run it, show them the verification URL/code
that appears, and wait for them to confirm before continuing.

Always confirm with the user before running CLI commands that create files or
modify their environment.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Plugin naming**: Must match `/^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{2,62}[a-z0-9]$/` — lowercase only, 4–64 chars, starts with a letter, ends with a letter or digit, no consecutive special chars
- **Hardcoded secrets**: Never hardcode API keys; always use the Credentials system
- **Model naming**: Must follow `provider/model_name` format (4–64 chars, alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen/slash only)
- **Dev key expiry**: Debug API key expires after 24 hours; run `atomemo plugin refresh-key` to renew
- **Missing registration**: Every tool/model/credential must be registered in `src/index.ts`
